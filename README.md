## Overview
MealPlanneR is a Shiny application intended to create a daily meal plan. Ultimately, this will also be an application for generating a shopping list based on that meal plan as well

## Adding Meal Options
To add additional meals as options for each mealtime, you'll need to edit the meals.csv file located in the data file. The first field will be the name of the entree and the second field will be the meal that it is available for (possible values are Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

## Upcoming Development
While this application (hopefully) provides a valuable service as a meal planner, the primary focus is to learn how to better leverage the Shiny framework. Possible areas of future development include:

  * Meal Recipe/Ingredient Lists
  * Shopping List Integration
  * UI for adding meals/recipes
  * UI for scraping internet recipes
